## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Create a Vercel account if you don't have one at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

2. Install Vercel CLI (optional):

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Create a `vercel.json` file in the project root:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/static-build"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/static/(.*)",
         "dest": "/static/$1"
       },
       {
         "src": "/favicon.ico",
         "dest": "/favicon.ico"
       },
       {
         "src": "/manifest.json",
         "dest": "/manifest.json"
       },
       {
         "src": "/(.*).(js|json|css|svg|png|jpg|jpeg|ico|ttf|woff|woff2)",
         "dest": "/$1.$2"
       },
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "/index.html"
       }
     ],
     "env": {
       "REACT_APP_API_URL": "https://roomloop-server.onrender.com/api",
       "REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL": "https://roomloop-server.onrender.com"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Connect your repository to Vercel:

   - Log in to Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Add New" > "Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Set the framework preset to "Create React App"
   - Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
     - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: https://roomloop-server.onrender.com/api
     - `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`: https://roomloop-server.onrender.com

5. Deploy the application:

   - If using CLI: Run `vercel` in the project directory
   - If using dashboard: The deployment will start automatically

6. Your application will be deployed to a URL like `roomloop.vercel.app`

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter dependency resolution errors during deployment:

1. **Version compatibility issues**: Make sure React and TypeScript type definitions are compatible with Material UI:

   - React 18.x is recommended with @types/react ^18.2.x
   - React 19.x may have compatibility issues with some MUI components

2. **Builder errors**: Ensure you're using the correct Vercel builder:
   - For React apps, use `@vercel/static-build` instead of `@vercel/node`
3. **Build script**: Make sure your package.json includes a `vercel-build` script:

   ```
   "scripts": {
     "vercel-build": "npm run build"
   }
   ```

4. **Environment variables**: Double-check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects the create-react-app configuration
