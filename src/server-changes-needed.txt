### Backend Changes Needed

To make private rooms appear in your Explore Rooms page, you need to add a new route in your server code.

## 1. Add this route to your server/src/routes/roomRoutes.js or similar file:

```javascript
// GET all rooms including private ones (with visibility control)
router.get('/all', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Get all public rooms
    const publicRooms = await Room.find({ 
      roomType: 'public',
    }).populate('creator', 'username email').sort({ startTime: 1 });

    // Get private rooms where the user is the creator, a participant, or invited
    const privateRooms = await Room.find({
      roomType: 'private',
      $or: [
        { creator: req.user.id },
        { participants: req.user.id },
        { invitedUsers: req.user.id }
      ]
    }).populate('creator', 'username email').sort({ startTime: 1 });

    // Combine the rooms
    const allRooms = [...publicRooms, ...privateRooms];
    
    res.json({ success: true, rooms: allRooms });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching all rooms:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

## 2. Testing

Once implemented on the server side, the frontend changes we've made will use this endpoint to fetch all rooms including private ones, and the filtering mechanism we've added will ensure private rooms are only shown in the "Private Rooms" tab.

**Note:** If you haven't already, make sure your server is running while testing this functionality.
